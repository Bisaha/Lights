# Lights
This is a rough graphic designed to demonstrate how much it would cost for a city to pay for 1,000 street lights each year if the city owned the lights. The rate for 70-watt LED and sodium street lights from Rockland Electric is offered as a comparison. 

While there are additional costs included with street lighting, such wiring, the costs factored into this graph are the maintenance expenses, the electricity to power the lights and the cost of the lights themesleves.
